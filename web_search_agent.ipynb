      "Slang used or popularized in the 2020s, usually by Generation Z (Gen Z), generally defined as people born between 1997 at the earliest and 2012 at the latest in the Western world,[note 1] or by Generation Alpha (those born between 2010 at the earliest and 2024 at the latest[7]), differs from that of earlier generations.[8][9] Ease of communication via social media and other internet outlets has facilitated its rapid proliferation, creating \"an unprecedented variety of linguistic variation\", according to Danielle Abril of the Washington Post.[9][10][11] Self-deprecating irony is often a prevalent factor in its use.\n",

      "Feeling a generation gap? Are you struggling to decipher the lingo the youngsters are throwing around? \n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't just a generational quirk; it's a reminder that language is constantly evolving! At ICLS, we're passionate about helping people bridge communication gaps, including keeping up with the latest trends. \n",
      "So, fear not! This guide will break down ten popular Gen Z phrases and slang terms so you can finally decipher their cryptic conversations (or at least pretend you do). Consider it a crash course in the ever-changing world of language! \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Busted: \n",
      "This doesn't mean something is broken anymore. In Gen Z speak, \"busted\" means you've been caught doing something wrong, like getting a bad grade or sneaking out past curfew. \n",
      "Example: \"I left my phone on silent during class and got busted by the teacher.\" \n",
      "2. Shook:\n",
      "Forget surprised; Gen Z uses \"shook\" to express a feeling of deep shock, disbelief, or utter amazement. \n",
      "Example: \"Did you see that dunk? I'm shook!\" \n",
      "3. Extra: \n",
      "This one's all about being over-the-top or excessive. It can be used positively for something impressive or negatively for someone being dramatic. \n",
      "Example (Positive): \"Her Halloween costume was extra this year!\" \n",
      "Example (Negative): \"Don't be extra, it's not a big deal.\" \n",
      "4. Salty: \n",
      "Move over, bitter. \"Salty\" describes someone feeling upset, jealous, or annoyed, often about someone else's success or good fortune. \n",
      "Example: \"He's salty because he didn't get the lead role in the play.\" \n",
      "5. Lowkey/Highkey: \n",
      "These adverbs add emphasis to how you feel about so\n",

(September 2025)\\n\\n (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nSlang used or popularized in the 2020s, usually by Generation Z (Gen Z), generally defined as people born between 1997 at the earliest and 2012 at the latest in the Western world,[note 1] or by Generation Alpha (those born between 2010 at the earliest and 2024 at the latest[7]), differs from that of earlier generations.[8][9] Ease of communication via social media and other internet outlets has facilitated its rapid proliferation, creating \"an unprecedented variety of linguistic variation\", according to Danielle Abril of the Washington Post.[9][10][11] Self-deprecating irony is often a prevalent factor in its use.\\nMany Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang terms were not originally coined by their generation but were already in use or simply became more mainstream. Much of what is considered Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang originates from African-American Vernacular English and ball culture.[9][12][13]\\n\\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

They may say things like, “I’m amped about my drip today,” or “He’s got rizz. Giving off major BDE.”\\nMaybe they’ve said something like, “No cap, this sandwich is bussin’,” or “Spill the tea, sis!”\\xa0\\nThe lingo our kids use every day may be incomprehensible to us, but these words actually have meaning—some we may know, and some we can understand from the context of the conversation.\\xa0\\nA number of these slang terms were created by past generations, while others are new terms that parents can be pretty clueless about. Some of these words are made up, shortened, or said as acronyms. Some slang terms are everyday words but hold different meanings.\\xa0\\nMany new terms stem organically from the online platforms kids commonly use to communicate today (which underscores the need for safe tech, especially when it comes to messaging).\\nWe’ve come up with a list of popular slang words to help parents better understand their kids and their friends.\\nThis list is not comprehensive but our team will add more words as we collect them and slang trends emerge.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that slang terms can vary widely based on location, culture, and generation, and some may have different meanings or connotations depending on the context.\\n\\nA-C\\n\\nA\\nAddy – Abbreviation for Address.\\nI’ll meet you there, just send me the addy.\\n\\nAF – An acronym that stands for As f**k.\\nI had the time of my life at the concert. It was lit AF!\\n\\nAmirite – An informal way to say “am I right,” used to seek agreement after making a statement.\\nThat taco was bomb, amirite?\\n\\nAmped – Excited\\nI’m amped for the concert tonight!\\n\\nAnd I oop – Used to express surprise, shock, or realization, often in response to something unexpected or amusing.\\xa0\\nShe accidentally knocked over her cup, and I oop, there it goes all over the floor.\\n\\nASL – An abbreviation for “as hell.” It is used as an intensifier. This term may also be used as an acronym for “age, sex, location,” to quickly inquire about someone’s basic demographic information. But that usage has mostly been replaced by Gen Z with the new “as hell” usage.\\nThose new shoes are cool asl.\\n\\nAte and left no crumbs – Refers to someone who did something so well that there’s no chance for anyone else to do it better.\\nDid you see Emma’s floor routine? She ate and left no crumbs!\\n\\nAura – Like the traditional definition, it is used to compliment someone’s ability, perceived power, or sense of coolness and mystery. It became popular in soccer and basketball communities on Twitter in 2023 so it is often used to compliment athletes.\\nDid you see Steph Curry’s clutch shot last nigh\\n--------------------------------------------------', name='web_search', id='2833d3bb-3f89-4aa3-b8a5-96a5c68b6582', tool_call_id='dd7ed2a3-2b8b-4cfa-830f-e578ff11c448'),\n",
